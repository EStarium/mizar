## Installation

Based on your operating system you can have one or more distribution formats to choose based on your preferences.  
Since Mizar is a free software we don't have a budget to spend on annual licenses or certificates. This can result that on some platforms you might need to put in some additional work to install this app.

### Linux

On Linux you can simply download and run the `.AppImage` distribution or install from Snap Store.

### Windows

On Windows you can choose between downloading the app from Microsoft Store or downloading the `.exe` from [this github repo](https://github.com/Fabio286/mizar/releases/latest).  
Distributions that are not from Microsoft Store are not signed with a certificate, so to install you need to click on "More info" and then "Run anyway" on SmartScreen prompt.
